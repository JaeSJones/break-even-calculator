A web-based Break-Even Calculator that helps clients calculate their minimum daily income to cover expenses and price services effectively.

Core Features:

Title at the top: “Break-Even Calculator” (no extra description).

Inputs for: Rent/Booth Fee, Supplies/Backbar, Insurance/Licenses, Marketing/Admin, Taxes Savings, Education/Tools, Miscellaneous, plus planned work days per week.

Results screen showing total monthly costs and minimum daily earnings needed to break even, with a detailed calculation breakdown.

Options to download results as PDF or email them (with email input field).

UX/UI:

Dark theme background using dark gray or charcoal tones—not pure black. The goal is a soft, comfortable dark mode like Facebook or Discord’s dark theme, not harsh or too dark.

Pastel accent colors: soft pink, mint green, pastel orange, pastel purple, used subtly for input fields and icons.

Icons for each expense category: sleek, gradient icons inside rounded squares (not circles).

Fonts: Modern, clean fonts such as Inter or Poppins, with polished spacing and visual balance.

Design should feel minimal but refined and professional—not overly simple or childish.

Subtle gradients, gentle shadows, and depth to create a more polished, premium feel.

Smooth, elegant animations and transitions for a high-end, seamless experience.

Mobile-friendly single-column layout with large, easy-to-tap inputs.

Enhancements:

Subtle hover effects on inputs to brighten pastel accents slightly.

Progress indicator showing “Step 1 of 2.”

Animated number counters for the results.

“Review & Edit” button to easily return to the input screen.

Tooltip hints for each expense category.

“Save Calculation” feature using local storage.

“Reset All” button to clear inputs quickly.

Gentle shake animation for missing fields.

Success checkmarks on completed fields.

Dollar sign placeholders in inputs and auto-formatting of numbers.

Option to toggle between weekly and monthly expenses.

Overall, the app should feel clean, sleek, and sophisticated—similar to the visual polish of high-end apps and websites—with a dark theme that feels modern and welcoming.
